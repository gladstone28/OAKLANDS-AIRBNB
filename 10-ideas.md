Certainly! Here are 10 practical and effective ideas you can implement outside of Airbnb to attract guests and increase your occupancy to over 20 days per month:

- Photos & virtual tour of your townhouse

- Availability calendar

  Engage with travel hashtags and run occasional giveaways or discounts.

Form alliances with:

  Offer a commission or discount to partners who refer guests.

4. List on Other Booking Platforms

Expand visibility by listing on:

- mBooking.com

- VRBO (Vacation Rentals By Owner)

- Expedia

  Make sure your calendars sync to avoid double bookings.

5. Attract Remote Workers and Digital Nomads

Offer:
